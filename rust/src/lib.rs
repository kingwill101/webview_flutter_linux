//! Native half of `webview_flutter_linux`.
//!
//! The library deliberately exposes a small C ABI rather than binding Dart to
//! Rust types. Dart creates a view through
//! `webview_flutter_linux_view_create`, retains the returned integer handle,
//! and supplies that handle to every later operation. The WPE module owns the
//! handle registry and the browser objects; the texture module owns the
//! Irondash registration and all EGL/GL state associated with a view.
//!
//! ## Threading model
//!
//! WPE and GLib objects are thread-affine and stay on Flutter's Linux platform
//! thread. Irondash asks for texture payloads on Flutter's raster thread, so
//! only the texture provider and its atomics/mutex-protected GL state cross the
//! thread boundary. Browser objects are never marked `Send` or `Sync`.
//!
//! ## ABI conventions
//!
//! Mutating functions return `0` on success and a negative status on failure.
//! Read-only accessors use zero as the invalid-handle/default value. Any ABI
//! shape change must increment `API_VERSION` and be mirrored in
//! `lib/src/native_frame_bindings.dart`.
